The power of the command line is often underrated. My developer journey led me to an almost 100% terminal-based way of working (and living), for this reason, I organized all my config files in this dotfiles repo, in order to keep track of my settings, programs, themes & more. Feel free to use whatever you want!

**NOTE:** This is a macOS-based setup in terms of paths & package managers, keep this in mind before trying to directly clone & setup all my configurations.

## Fonts

My setup currently uses Mozilla's original [Fira Mono](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) (specifically the [NF patched version](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira)). It preserves a decent line height that is comfortable to the eyes and a good aspect ratio for my coding preferences. All my fonts can be found inside the `.fonts` directory.

## Inspiration

All my doftfiles have some bit of inspiration on other repos I've encountered throughout my days, you should definitely check out the following:

- Kutsan Kaplan's [dotfiles](https://github.com/kutsan/dotfiles).
- Lukas Reineke's [config files](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/dotfiles).
