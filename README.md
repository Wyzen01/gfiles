The power of the command line is often underrated. My developer journey led me to an almost 100% terminal-based way of working (and living), for this reason, I organized all my config files in this dotfiles repo, in order to keep track of my settings, programs, themes & more. Feel free to use whatever you want!

**NOTE:** This is a macOS-based setup in terms of paths & package managers, keep this in mind before trying to directly clone & setup all my configurations.

## Tools

As a command-line user, all of my tools are terminal-based, therefore I can group all of them in 3 major categories:

- My **terminal emulator**.
- My **editor**.
- My **utilities**.

### Terminal emulator

For my terminal emulator, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), the macOS terminal replacement.

I also use [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) as my main interactive shell, loading my own theme, along with plugins such as:

- [`zsh-z`](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z) - Jump quickly to directories that you have visited "frecently".
- [`zsh-autosuggestions`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - Fish-like autosuggestions for Zsh.
- [`zsh-syntax-highlighting`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Fish shell like syntax highlighting for Zsh.

### Editor

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my main text-editor for everything, from scripting to web development to mobile applications and even machine learning & data science.

### Utilities

Editing is not the only thing to do when it comes to terminals, this are the set of utilities I use on a daily basis to perform tasks regarding version control, project management, connectivity & more:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
- [`fnm`](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#shell-setup) - Fast and simple Node.js version manager, built in Rust.
  - [`node`](https://nodejs.org/es/) - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) - The free NPM registry has become the center of JavaScript code sharing, and with more than one million packages, the largest software registry in the world.
- [`brew`](https://brew.sh/index_es) - Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didnâ€™t include with macOS.
- [`exa`](https://github.com/ogham/exa) - A modern replacement for `ls`.
- [`macfetch`](https://github.com/gantoreno/macfetch) - A macOS Neofetch alternative written in C++.
- [`curl`](https://curl.se/) - command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.
- [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) - GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS, the most widely used Internet protocols.
- [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) - Ngrok provides a real-time web UI where you can introspect all HTTP traffic running over your tunnels.
- [`openssh`](https://www.openssh.com/) - OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol.
- [`openssl`](https://www.openssl.org/) - OpenSSL is a robust, commercial-grade, and full-featured toolkit for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols.
